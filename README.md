What does matchscores_v2.py do?
===============================
This code collects (from the Blue Alliance) scores (ccwm, opr, and dpr) for all FRC teams in a desired event. Scores are collected from each team's 
most recent completed event. The scores are collected for every qualifying match that we are taking part in, and the scores are separated according to 
whether the teams are on our alliance or the opposing alliance. There are therefore six sets of scores for each match that we are taking part in.
[WORK IN PROGRESS _ PLEASE BE PATIENT!]
